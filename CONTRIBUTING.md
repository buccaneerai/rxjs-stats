# Contributing
:thumbsup: Thank you for your interest in contributing.  To develop better data science tools, JavaScript very much needs the help of opensource contributors!

## The Code
Let's keep things simple.  As contributors to the [Swashbuckler](https://swashbuckler.ai) project, we all agree to the following social contract:
- We agree to keep a positive attitude and treat each other with respect.
- We agree to make decisions and act in accordance with the [Project's Goals](https://github.com/buccaneerai/rxjs-stats/blob/master/docs/Guides/ProjectGoals.md), even if they may differ somewhat from our personal preferences and goals.
- We agree to treat end users and other community remembers with respect, even if their level of experience and knowledge is different than our own. (Even if someone is disrespectful to us it still reflects poorly on the project if we lower ourselves to that level.)
- We agree to practice honesty and not to mislead or badmouth our co-collaborators.
- We agree to welcome others into the project and help them learn.
- We agree that anyone who violates these rules should fess up and apologize.  
- We agree that project maintainers reserve the right to kick out any collaborator who breaks the social contract. 

If you agree, then great! Welcome aboard matey!

## Getting started

### Dependencies
Contributors will need to install these dependencies:
- node.js >10 (nvm is recommended but not required)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >1.12

### Installation
To contribute to `rxjs-stats`, you'll need a working copy of the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/buccaneerai/rxjs-stats.git
cd rxjs-stats
yarn install
```

## Recommended Workflow
We generally use the "pull request" workflow for all changes to the package. It typically works like this:
- Cut a feature branch from dev: `git checkout -b new-feature`
- Make changes on the branch
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Lint the code (using Airbnb Style): `yarn lint`
- Commit changes to the branch and push it to GitHub
- Make a pull request to the `dev` branch
- A project maintainer will review the pull request and do a code review

:bulb: If you aren't a listed contributor to the project, then you can also fork the repository and make a pull request.

## Creating new operators
If you want to create new operators, [we have a guide for that here](https://github.com/buccaneerai/rxjs-stats/blob/master/docs/Guides/CreatingOperators.md).

## Communication
If enough contributors want to be involved, then we'll setup a chatroom.  In the meantime, you can [email the project authors](mailto:opensource@buccaneer.ai).
