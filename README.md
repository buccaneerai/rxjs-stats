## Purpose

Why does this package exist? The engineering team at [Buccaneer](https://www.buccaneer.ai) wanted a set of of RxJS 6 operators to perform common calculations used in statistics, data science, math, analytics and machine learning. These tools did not exist so they had to be built from scratch. `rxjs-stats` was born and released as an opensource package so the entire Javascript community could use it!
