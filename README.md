## Purpose

Why does this package exist? The engineering team at [Buccaneer](https://www.buccaneer.ai) wanted a set of of RxJS 6 operators to perform common calculations used in statistics, data science, math, analytics and machine learning. These tools did not exist so they had to be built from scratch. `rxjs-stats` was born and released as an opensource package so the entire Javascript community could use it, improve upon it and build cool stuff!

ðŸ’¡ `rxjs-stats` is part of a larger effort to build top-notch data science and machine learning tools for JavaScript. If you'd like to help make this happen, contributors and sponsors can help us move forward faster!

## Contributing
Want to help build top-notch machine learning tools for JavaScript?  We could use your help.  

## Sponsors
If you're part of an enterprise that uses full-stack JavaScript, please consider sponsoring the project on [Patreon]() or allowing members of your software team to contribute some time to the project.  We believe full-stack engineering shops benefit when teams can develop frontend, backend, mobile, desktop in a single language.

Any money contributed is used to pay for long-term maintanence, project infrastructure, engineering hours, bug fixes, new features and other improvements that benefit users of the package.
